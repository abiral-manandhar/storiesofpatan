Team Hiti! At Incubate Nepal 2024, they’ll document Patan’s complex relationship with water, from the sacred Bagmati River to urban floods. Through research, surveys, curatorial walks, interviews, and workshops, they’ll capture the historic and modern water challenges and solutions, culminating in an insightful exhibition.
